You start in a better position than AI Nations, who will rarely attack and whose Units are slightly weakened.</div> </a><a href="/quarry/difficultyLevels/DIFFICULTYMODE_GOOD/" class="block rounded border border-stone-200 bg-white px-4 py-3 hover:bg-stone-50 hover:border-stone-300 transition-colors"> <div class="font-medium">The Good</div> <div class="text-sm text-stone-500 mt-1 line-clamp-2">AI Nations start with some development, according to the game's premise that you are a new nation in a world of established nations. AI Nations at this difficulty are inclined to be peaceful but may eventually declare war.</div> </a><a href="/quarry/difficultyLevels/DIFFICULTYMODE_STRONG/" class="block rounded border border-stone-200 bg-white px-4 py-3 hover:bg-stone-50 hover:border-stone-300 transition-colors"> <div class="font-medium">The Strong</div> <div class="text-sm text-stone-500 mt-1 line-clamp-2">This is the baseline difficulty of the game and the first difficulty level at which AI Nations are not restricted in warfare. They will declare war more freely and will use <a href="/quarry/concepts/CONCEPT_MARCH/" class="text-blue-700 hover:text-blue-900 underline decoration-blue-300">Forced March</a>. Tribal raids also become more common, and Cities near the map edges are no longer safe from distant tribal raids. Your baseline economy is the same as that of AI nations.</div> </a><a href="/quarry/difficultyLevels/DIFFICULTYMODE_NOBLE/" class="block rounded border border-stone-200 bg-white px-4 py-3 hover:bg-stone-50 hover:border-stone-300 transition-colors"> <div class="font-medium">The Noble</div> <div class="text-sm text-stone-500 mt-1 line-clamp-2">Harder difficulties begin here. AI Nations begin the game with more Cities and with a slightly stronger economy.</div> </a><a href="/quarry/difficultyLevels/DIFFICULTYMODE_GLORIOUS/" class="block rounded border border-stone-200 bg-white px-4 py-3 hover:bg-stone-50 hover:border-stone-300 transition-colors"> <div class="font-medium">The Glorious</div> <div class="text-sm text-stone-500 mt-1 line-clamp-2">AI Nations are more aggressive than on lower difficulties and can attack earlier. They also gain a small advantage to Research and economy. Tribal Units get an additional Fatigue point, making raiders considerably more dangerous than at lower difficulties.</div> </a><a href="/quarry/difficultyLevels/DIFFICULTYMODE_MAGNIFICENT/" class="block rounded border border-stone-200 bg-white px-4 py-3 hover:bg-stone-50 hover:border-stone-300 transition-colors"> <div class="font-medium">The Magnificent</div> <div class="text-sm text-stone-500 mt-1 line-clamp-2">A very challenging difficulty in which your economy is weaker than that of AI Nations, who begin the game with multiple Cities and researched Technologies. Avoiding early war is critical, as AI Nations start with enough power to easily crush you.</div> </a><a href="/quarry/difficultyLevels/DIFFICULTYMODE_GREAT/" class="block rounded border border-stone-200 bg-white px-4 py-3 hover:bg-stone-50 hover:border-stone-300 transition-colors"> <div class="font-medium">The Great</div> <div class="text-sm text-stone-500 mt-1 line-clamp-2">The highest difficulty. AI Nations get a moderate economy bonus in addition to being well established at the game's start. They will not wait long before demanding tribute or attacking you outright. You will face many tribal raids and an increased chance of domestic rebels.</div> </a> </div>  </main> <footer class="mt-16 border-t border-stone-200 py-6 text-center text-sm text-stone-500">
