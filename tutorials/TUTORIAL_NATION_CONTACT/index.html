If you hover the mouse over a Nation's name in the leaderboard at the top left of screen, you can find out important information about them, such as the number of Cities they have, how strong their Military is, how developed they are technologically, and also with whom they are currently at <span class="font-medium">War</span> or <span class="font-medium">Peace</span>.<br><br>To conduct diplomacy, you must appoint an <a href="/quarry/councils/COUNCIL_AMBASSADOR/" class="text-blue-700 hover:text-blue-900 underline decoration-blue-300">Ambassador</a> (requires <a href="/quarry/technologies/TECH_ARISTOCRACY/" class="text-blue-700 hover:text-blue-900 underline decoration-blue-300">Aristocracy</a>).</div> </div> </div>  </main> <footer class="mt-16 border-t border-stone-200 py-6 text-center text-sm text-stone-500">
